* Tipboxes done by TerminusEst13 (thanks!).
* New railgun stuff by the same person(s) behind Doom 64 Stuff.
* Previous railgun (horrible pre-v6 version) modified out of plasma gun sprites by tehvappy50. Feel free to laugh at how much it sucked.

===================================================
======== NOW COMPATIBLE WITH SAMSARA V0.28 ========
===================================================


KNOWN STUFF
- DO NOT ASK TERMINUSEST13 ABOUT THIS CLASS IT'S NOT HIS IT'S IVANDOBROVSKI'S. SEND BUG REPORTS TO THIS FAG!
- Credits mostly go to elZee for his code which I based most stuff on.
- We don't have a samsara-like hud yet, I know. I can't generate art!
- Thanks a lot to Interceptor Entertainment, especially Andrew Hulshult for his epic GDTFW remake!
	The intro song will play everytime a round begins on LMS game mode, to turn it off type "set notheme 1" to your console.
	^^^ Due to some bugs this is cancelled, the music is still in there though.
- The Slot I for Blake Stone is an ammo refill item. To get rid of the "use then pick it up again for infinite refill" bug, I used some "band aids", one thing
that I couldn't fix was the weapon state being shown as "still pickable" while in reality you can't pick it in the map if you picked it once.



CONTAINS ADDITIONAL STUFF FROM SAMSARA 0.27b SO IF SOMETHING CHANGES WITH THOSE DO NOT USE THIS WITH IT WITHOUT ASKING IVAN! (Things may break!)

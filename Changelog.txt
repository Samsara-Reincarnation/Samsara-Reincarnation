StrifeGuy:

- Added Blackbird radio chatter in the form of taunts
- Implemented the Gas Grenades that were cut from the final product. They work similarly to White Phosphorus grenades, but deal poison damage and don't creep slowly around surfaces. The damage output is very high, even higher than WP grenades, but they cannot effect robots and deal half-damage to cyborgs and creatures made of slime.

- Mines can be destroyed with explosives in all game modes
- Space Seal's weapons deal slightly higher damage in DM, as Corridor 7 was one of the first games to have dedicated Deathmatch mode with it own maps, predating Rise of the Triad by a few months. Made sense knowing this fun fact to have Space Seal be the dedicated DM beginner class.
- The Alien Plasma Rifle increases in damage as the projectile travels, and on a direct hit the damage, whatever it is, is dealt in full.
- Alien Plasma Rifle fires slightly slower and only consumes 1 rocket instead of 2.

* Note 1: Punchdrunk isnt made yet because im out of time.

* Note 2: Im trying to fill every missing thing, so i wish that this
		  wont feel incomplete anymore. (Please, check Note 1*)

* Note 3: I hope that this is compatible with Hexen & Strife (wew) now.  
 
* Note 4: The Eradicator addon could have a lot of better effects & visual things, but some of the required graphics 
		  were just impossible to rip.
	
* Note 5: Tipboxes for Strifeguy and Eleena will be included in the next version of this.

* Note 6: If something isnt working well, please let me know! (Any feedback will be appreciated too!)

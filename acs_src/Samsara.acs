								Any changes to a file prefixed "SAMSARA", compile this

												-Index-
												
1) commonFuncs.acs
	Modified for new classes?: No
	Edit Frequency: Low
	
	Purpose: This file is used by Samsara across the board and contains useful functions, often mathematical or serve 
	rather tedious purposes.
	
2) SamsaraDefs.acs
	Modified for new classes?: Yes
	Edit Frequency: Medium
	
	Purpose: This file contains a good majority of arrays and other variables that is used by the Samsara ACS 
	library. 
	
3) SamsaraWeps.acs
	Modified for new classes?: Yes
	Edit Frequency: High
	
	Purpose: This file contains weapon array information, as well as few weapon related variables.
	
4) SamsaraFuncs.acs
	Modified for new classes?: No
	Edit Frequency: Very Low

	Purpose: This contains some Samsara specific functions, whereas commonFuncs can be used with any other mod in 
	theory.
	
5) SamsaraSounds.acs
	Modified for new classes?: Yes
	Edit Frequency: Medium

	Purpose: This file contains sound information for the classes. This file usually only gets touched when new 
	classes or alt-classes are added. These arrays are needed because of the way Samsara gives weapons.
	
6) SamsaraMsgs.acs
	Modified for new classes?: Yes
	Edit Frequency: Medium

	Purpose: This one is much the same as SamsaraSounds but handles pickup messages instead. Also contains the 
	alternative pickup messages.
	
7) SamsaraTipbox.acs
	Modified for new classes?: No
	Edit Frequency: Never

	Purpose: This one is here just for legacy purposes and is likely to get removed. It's basically just the old
	tipbox handler that has been replaced with the Compendium.
	
8) SamsaraPickup.acs
	Modified for new classes?: No
	Edit Frequency: Low

	Purpose: This one handles about half of the Samsara pickup code, the other half being in SamsaraFuncs. The
	scripts here are sort of the middle-man between Decorate and the functions in SamsaraFuncs, but also important.
	
9) SamsaraPickup.acs
	Modified for new classes?: No
	Edit Frequency: Low

	Purpose: This one handles about half of the Samsara pickup code, the other half being in SamsaraFuncs. The
	scripts here are sort of the middle-man between Decorate and the functions in SamsaraFuncs, but also important.
	
10) SamsaraStrife.acs
	 Modified for new classes?: No
	 Edit Frequency: Very Low

	 Purpose: This one was touched until some of the items were swapped around. Important, but not important enough
	 to touch.
	
11) SamsaraEvent.acs
	 Modified for new classes?: No
	 Edit Frequency: Very High
	
	 Purpose: This one contains common looping code for each class and essentially the whole game sim. These scripts
	 are run during certain events such as respawning or on death. Many classes use SamsaraSpawn to handle scripted
	 actions, while others may use the external class library.
	
12) SamsaraScheduled.acs
	 Modified for new classes?: No
	 Edit Frequency: Never
	
	 Purpose: Frankly I don't even know what this one does.
	 
13) SamsaraPDWTAK.acs
	 Modified for new classes?: No
	 Edit Frequency: Never
	
	 Purpose: I don't know much about people die when they are killed, but I've never touched this in the 7 or so
	 years I've been working on this project.
	 
14) SamsaraGeneral.acs
	 Modified for new classes?: Yes
	 Edit Frequency: Very High
	
	 Purpose: This file contains a bunch of general scripts that don't serve just one purpose but are sort of used
	 across the board in Samsara. These aren't highly worthy of having their own .acs files, but maybe some day that
	 will be a thing.
	 
15) SamsaraAllies.acs
	 Modified for new classes?: No
	 Edit Frequency: High
	
	 Purpose: This file contains information related to random characters or allies from heroes.
	 
16) SamsaraMonologue.acs
	 Modified for new classes?: No
	 Edit Frequency: High
	
	 Purpose: This is the monologue code for bosses. It's quite lengthy and does a bunch of redundant stuff, so it
	 kind of deserves it's own file.
	 
17) SamsaraXMas.acs
	 Modified for new classes?: No
	 Edit Frequency: Low
	
	 Purpose: This is the XMas code that modifies the map.
	 
18) SamsaraQuake.acs
	 Modified for new classes?: No
	 Edit Frequency: Low
	
	 Purpose: This would go into the class library if it weren't for the fact that the scripts in here are far too
	 embedded in Samsara's own ACS. Besides, some of these are shared between Ranger and Bitterman.
